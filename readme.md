Python scripts to analyze scanning probe images.

It currently works with Nanonis sxm and CreaTec dat files for scanning probe microscopy (SPM), such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

An example jupyter-notebook file can be found in the "demo" directory.

| Examples  |      |
| --- | --- |
| ![Plot image channels](demo/example_plot.png?raw=true "Plot image channels")  |  ![Interactive filters](demo/example_filter.png?raw=true "Interactive filters") |
| Plot image channels next to each other. The color scale can be adjusted interactively for each channel. |  Interactive filters |
